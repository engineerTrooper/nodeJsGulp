My NodeJs Gulp scripts to get tasks in processes automated.

These Scripts I am using in my projects with gulp.
Use them as you like, share them, ... whatever.

I woulde be glad to get recommendation and a backlink to my website [www.engineertrooper.com](https://engineertrooper.com) or this repository.

I am also happy about suggestion and improvments via pull request.
