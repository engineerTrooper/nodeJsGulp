# nodeJsGulp
My NodeJs Gulp scripts to get tasks in processes automated.

These Scripts I am using in my projects with gulp.
Use them as you like, share them, ... whatever.

I woulde be glad to get recommendation and a backlink to my website [www.engineertrooper.com](https://engineertrooper.com) or this repository.

I am also happy about suggestion and improvments via pull request.


# Using gulpfiles without renaming
To use one of my files without renaming them to
```
gulpfile.js
``` 
You have to write a command like that 
```
gulp --gulpfile <filename>.js watch
```
for example:
```
gulp --gulpfile gulpfile-KirbyCms.js watch
```

# Please keep in mind
Not all files will have a public repository. Where you could check out how the script works in real environment. The following gulp scripts have a public repository:
